In our login page we have set 5 user names which are (Inish, Bikas, Bibhas, Manish and Admin).
The password for all the user name is set as admin.
When the username and password are correct it allows the user to access data and if the username or password is incorrect or those places are kept blank the system replies invalid
e-mail or password.

We can add, delete, search and update records in the student managemnt system as per our needs but while adding the information or the updating if any entry is empty then it replies as
all fields required. And the user needs to fill all the vaccant spaces with asked information.
